Array list  vs   Vectors
 Vectors						Array list
1-vectors makes there size double(100%) 		1-array lists make their sizes 50% 
2-vectors are synchronised			           	2-array lists are asynchronised		

HashSet vs SortedSet
 HashSet					                                	SortedSet
1-set interface					                            1-set interface
2-elements are not in sorted order			            2-elements stored in sorted order
3-duplication is allowed				                    3-duplication is allowed
4-speed of insertion , deletion is very fast        4- speed of insertion , deletion is slow 
5-null objects are allowed                          5-null objects are not allowed

TreeSet vs HashSet
 HashSet						                                TreeSet
1-set interface					                            1-set interface
2-elements are not in sorted order			            2-elements stored in sorted order
3-duplication is not allowed				                3-duplication is not  allowed
4-speed of insertion , deletion is very fast        4- speed of insertion , deletion is slow 
5-null objects are allowed                          5-null objects are not allowed

Array vs List
Array                                                 Lists
1-fixed size array					                        1-dynamic sized array
2-homogeneous elements				                      2-hetrogenous elements (different types)
3-basic functionality                               3- part of collection framework		

List vs Set
List                                                  Set
1-ordered collection					                      1-unordered collection of elements
2-maintains insertion order			                  	2-does not maintains insertion order
3-duplication is allowed				                    3-duplication is not allowed
4-positional access is allowed			                4-positional access is not allowed

NavigableSet vs NavigableMap
NavigableSet				                                 NavigableMap
1-sorted set interface				                      1-mapâ€™s interface 
2-behave like sortedset with navigable methods      2-there is a key value pair
3-like sets duplication is not allowed              3-key is of string type and value is of integer 
4-we can get the revers order due to navigation     4- duplication of key is not allowed value may be
